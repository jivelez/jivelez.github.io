### Data Analysis in Engineerig II
This is a course offered to 6th semester students of the [Industrial Engineering](https://www.uninorte.edu.co/web/ingenieria-industrial) program. It is meant to introduce basic and intermediate concepts in

1. Simple and Multiple Linear Regression
2. Advanced Linear Regression Models, which include Nonlinear Regression, Logistic Regression and Poisson Regression
3. Time Series Analysis, including stationary and nonstationary time series, Smoothing and ARIMA$(p,d,q)$ models
4. Nonparametric statistics

This has been offered during the 2016-10, 2016-30, 2017-10, 2017-30, 2018-10,  2018-30, 2019-10 and 2019-30 semesters.

### Design of Experiments 
This course is offered every year to [MSc](https://www.uninorte.edu.co/web/maestria-en-ingenieria-industrial) and [PhD](https://www.uninorte.edu.co/web/doctorado-en-ingenieria-industrial) students in Industrial Engineering, and [MSc](https://www.uninorte.edu.co/web/maestria-en-ciencias-basicas-biomedicas) and [PhD](https://www.uninorte.edu.co/web/doctorado-en-ciencias-biomedicas) students in Biomedical Sciences. We explore the fundamentals of 

1. One- and two-fixed factors experimental designs
2. Blocking
3. Designs with one- and two-random factors
4. $2^k$ and $3^k$ designs
5. Response surface methodology

This course has been offered during the 2017-30, 2018-30 and 2019-30 semesters.

### Introduction to Bioinformatics
This is an introductory course for  [MSc](https://www.uninorte.edu.co/web/maestria-en-ciencias-basicas-biomedicas) and [PhD](https://www.uninorte.edu.co/web/doctorado-en-ciencias-biomedicas) students of the Biomedical Sciences program.  Here we discuss: 

1. Genome organization
2. How *omics* data are generated
3. Sequencing techniques, including whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing and genotyping as well as TaqMan assays. We also include [vcf](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/online/course/human-genetic-variation-i-introduction-2019/variant-identification-and-analysis-0#targetText=VCF%20is%20the%20standard%20file%20format%20for%20storing%20variation%20data.&targetText=VCF%20is%20a%20preferred%20format,are%20tab%20delimited%20text%20files.), [BAM](https://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/BAM) and [SAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAM_(file_format)) formats
4. Genome and protein databases and how to query them
5. How to perform functional prediction of biological sequences

This course has been offered during the 2017-30 and 2018-30 semesters.

### Population Genetics
This course is offered to  [MSc](https://www.uninorte.edu.co/web/maestria-en-ciencias-basicas-biomedicas) and [PhD](https://www.uninorte.edu.co/web/doctorado-en-ciencias-biomedicas)  students in Biomedical Sciences. We discuss

1. General concepts of genetics, including allele frequencies at the population level, the Hardy-Weinberg principle and its implications
2. Principles of Genetic Epidemiology, including inheritance models, pleiotropy, variable expressivity and modifier genes
3. Segregation, linkage and association analysis, genetic differentiation and genetic diversity in humans

This course has been offered during the 2017-10, 2018-10 and 2019-10 semesters.

### Biostatistics for Biomedical Sciences
I will be teaching this course during the 2019-30 semester. This course is oriented to  [MSc](https://www.uninorte.edu.co/web/maestria-en-ciencias-basicas-biomedicas) and [PhD](https://www.uninorte.edu.co/web/doctorado-en-ciencias-biomedicas)  students in Biomedical Sciences. 

<br>


### Applied Data Science (coming soon!)
This a new elective course at Universidad del Norte. It will be offered to BSc students mainly from the Engineering, Psychology, Mathematics and Economy undergraduate programs.

We will discuss elements of Data Analytics, Computational Statistics, Dimensionality Reduction Techniques, Predictive Modelling and Data Visualization. Of course, most of the work will be performed in [R](https://www.r-project.org/).
