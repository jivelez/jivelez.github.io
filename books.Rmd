I am currently preparing the textbook _Modelos de Regresión: Una aproximación práctica con R_. 

This book is designed to cover most of the topics discussed in the course [Data Analysis in Engineering II](https://jivelez.github.io/teaching.html). A preliminary version of this book is available from [here](https://jivelez.github.io/book-adii/). 

Comments, suggestions and recommendations are always welcome.
